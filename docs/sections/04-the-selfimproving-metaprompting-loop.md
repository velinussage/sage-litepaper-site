# The Self-Improving Metaprompting Loop

1.  **Publish**  
    Authors codify collective knowledge into human-readable manifests. **IPFS** CIDs anchor the canonical version for humans and agents alike.

2.  **Curate**  
    The community proposes variants, votes, and executes upgrades on-chain. Approver Councils can be badge-gated to fast-track scoped changes while governance stays in charge.

3.  **Reward**  
    **Boosts** pay voters or contributors for high-signal interventions. **Bounties** fund targeted experiments. **Premiums** monetize specialized instructions. Treasury routes and guardrails stay programmable through governance.

4.  **Use and Measure**  
    Agents fetch context via **MCP**, execute within approved bounds, and feed results back through on-chain signals- forks, bounty completions, and proposal outcomes- that close the learning loop.
